# Ada Constraint_Error Example

This repository demonstrates a common error in Ada programming: the `Constraint_Error` exception. This exception is raised when a value is assigned to a variable that violates the declared subtype's range constraints.

The `bug.ada` file contains code that might raise this exception. The `solution.ada` file shows a corrected version that handles the potential error using exception handling.

## Running the Code

You will need an Ada compiler (like GNAT) to compile and run the code.  Compile and run each file separately.
